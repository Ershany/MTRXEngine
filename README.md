# PhysicsEngine

Author: Mohamed Kazma
Description: This is a physics engine that i am working on on the side just for the fun of it 
hoping it will be a nice learning experience and some nice things can be accomplished.


TO DO:
- Implement GJK collision detection which allows for collision detection between convex hulls

- Add some collision response by calculating some collision info within GJK for example 

- Add a build a convex hull function that will allow us to build convex hulls

- Implement mesh collider collision detection

- Implement Capsule collider collision detection

- Refactor and revisit the architecture 

- Implement some actual physics behavior such as kinematics and forces etc...

- Implement rigidbody physics

- Implement joint physics

PS: NAME OF ENGINE TBD 
- ATM thinking of the matrix engine (MTRX-ENGINE) or smthg like that
